        <h3>History</h3>
		<p>Indonesian massage therapy is an oriental type of massage method that uses both Chinese and Ayurvedic  method in healing, revitalizing, calming and soothing the clients body. This type of massage was brought to Indonesia by the traveling Buddhist monks which later passed this medical care to the practicing monks who went on to develop and improve it by adding herbal medicines which was inspired by the ancient Chinese tradition.</p>
		<p>Indonesia massage therapy traces back to 4000 years ago and back then was used as the main source of medical care for people, there certainly wasnâ€™t the medical services that you would find today and definitely no National Health Services! You would have especially  found that royalties during this time used this type of massage as a treatment to help them to relax and to relieve them off stress.</p>

        <p>An Indonesian massage is strongly therapeutic and regenerative and will last around 90 minutes. Strong pushing techniques predominate, working extremely deeply to stimulate and relax the soft tissues and clear the body of blockages along the meridians and release built up tension. The massage, along with the use of coconut oil, which is used as the medium for Indonesian massage also helps release toxins, relieves tension and improves blood circulation.</p>
	   <p>With an Indonesian massage you will find it is not only therapeutic but also corrective, as it can soothe stiff and painful muscles while also alleviating abdominal complaints such as constipation, indigestion, bloating, heartburn and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). By concentrating on the meridian energy lines which run through the body, the massage produces a holistic healing experience for the whole body.</p>

          <p><span>&#171;</span> Very nice and professional establishment. After a week of Travel it was a much needed exxperience. The masseuse did a great job. Once she found a knot she was aggressive but gentle working it out. I'd recommend it. <span>&#187;</span> - Chris A. Coquitlam, BC</p>
